### Optimized Version README.md

```markdown
# Optimized GPT Text Generation

This repository contains an optimized and advanced version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) text generation script using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Features

- Improved code structure for better modularity and readability.
- Added error handling to catch and handle exceptions.
- User interaction for customizing maximum length, temperature, and model name.
- Encapsulated the main logic in a `main()` function for clarity.
- Enhanced user guidance with input prompts.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd optimized-gpt-text-generation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install transformers
```

3. Open the `optimized_gpt_text_generation.py` script and follow the input prompts to provide a prompt, maximum length, temperature, and model name.

4. Run the script:

```
python optimized_gpt_text_generation.py
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- transformers library


You can replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository. These README files provide clear instructions on how to use the scripts and describe the features and improvements made in the optimized version.
